### About Me

I'm Demir EryÄ±lmaz, I was born in 21st of February 2005 in Istanbul Turkey. I'm a rising senior at Robert College of Istanbul. I enjoy playing basketball. I also fancy reading books, playing video games, and STEM studies. In the future, I'd like to study Biomedical Engineering, and I feel that this class would create a strong foundation of engineering skills. I want to be able to create simple and complex devices that would benefit people in some way.
