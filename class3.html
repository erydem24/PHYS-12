        <p>In our first class of the second week, we started with the usual assignment reviews. They were some people who volunteered to present their work, not me though :) It will take me time to develop the confidence in my work to be able to present it. After that we talked about power and made an introduction to DC motors. We also talked about soldering and learn how to solder wires. After some safety instructions, I was able to solder multiple cables together. We also learned how to saw wood safely.  </p>

        For today's assignment, we were asked to create a kinetic sculpture using a DC motor. I created a landsacpe sculpture with a rod, symbolizing the day and the night.

        It's simple but does the job. I used cardboards for the 2 platforms, and connected them with pieces of wood and hot glue. Then I used 2 balls, painted one yellow to make the sun, attached them to a rod, and attached the rod to the motor using a very specific piece.
