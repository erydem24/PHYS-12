  <h1>Lecture 2: 2D Design & Cutting</h1>
  
  <p>
    In our second class of the first week, we kicked off with splitting into 2 groups. One gruop would learn how to use laser cutting and the other group would learn about different design appliactions such as Fusion 360 and Blender. After that we started to construct our own press-fit construction kit.
  
  <h2>Assignment</h2>

  <p>
  Our first assignment was to open up a website from GitHub that would act as a journal tracking our development. To do this, we went over a tutorial about how to open up a GitHub repository, then we downloaded Sublime Text and used it to create and customize our own website with HTML and CSS. I am a beginner in coding so these steps were quite the challenge for me. But I'm staritng to figure out day by day how to code.  </p>
