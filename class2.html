        <p>In our second class of the first week, we kicked off with splitting into 2 groups. One gruop would learn how to use laser cutting and the other group would learn about different design appliactions such as Fusion 360 and Blender. We also learned about vinyl cutting. After that we started to construct our own press-fit construction kit using Fusion 360 or Blender.</p>

      <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>In our assignment for this week, we were asked to create a press-fit construction kit using a 3D design app such as Autodesk Fusion 360 or Blender. I prefered to use Fusion 360 since I thought it was much easier and more functional compared to Blender. We would use laser cutting to create our construction kits from cardboard. The basics of creating such kits rely on making a 2D sketch in Fusion360, extruding it into 3D, making a 2D projection of the new body, converting that to a DXF file, and then using the lazer cutter to obtain the final shapes.

        <p> In creating my press-fit construction kit, I wanted to do something simple but with a flair. I was going to choose triangles, but I saw most people using triangles, so I passed on triangles. Then I thought about pentagons and hexagons, but given my relative incompetence and beginerness, I thought it would be quite the work. So I chose squares. But my squares were not just squares. I added a little flair by smoothening the edges and giving it a somewhat circular shape. Also I went for bigger pieces, just to be more different.

        <br>

        <p> I started off by sketching a square with a 50 millimeter side length. Then I offsetted the sketch by 10 millimeters to the outside for the connection slots. After that I drew construction lines from the midpoints of the sides, then offsetting those lines by a parameter i defined as "thickness/2 - kerf". This would allow me to create slots that fit perfectly to each other, also putting the kerf into consideration. Kerf is how much material the laser burns when cutting. So keeping kerf in mind is important. 
        </p>

          <br>

        <p> The parameters that I defined are now "thickness = 3.80", "kerf = 0.20" and "width = thickness/2 - kerf". Then I completed my sketching and started to add the 3rd dimension. I started the process by extruding my sketch by 3.8 millimeters, which is the same as the width of the cardboard. Then I filed the edges of the connection slots by 2 millimeters to get that smooth connection in. I then filed my squares with a radius of 15 millimeters. </p>

          <br>

        <P> Now I was ready to laser cut my shapes. I started with making a 2D projection of my 3D shape. Then I imported the file as DXF to the laser cutter. I used Rhino 7 to print my shapes since it seemed much easier and shorter. Then I started to laser cut my shapes. After a while
