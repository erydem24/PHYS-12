        <p>In our first class of the course Introduction to Digital Fabrication, we started off with introducing ourselves, our backgrounds, and our motivation to take this course. Then we went over the course syllabus and talked about what our duties and responsibilites are. Mr. Melenbrink talked about how can we do good in our projects. Then we brainstormed about our final project ideas and talked to our peers about ideas. After getting assigned to our lab section, we ended our day with working on our 1st assignment of opening a website for our final project, briefly going over HTML and CSS while doing so.</p>

      <h2>Assignment</h2>

        <p>our first assignment was to open up a website from GitHub that would act as a journal tracking our development. To do this, we went over a tutorial about how to open up a GitHub repository, then we downloaded Sublime Text and used it to create and customize our own website with HTML and CSS. I am a beginner in coding so these steps were quite the challenge for me. But I'm staritng to figure out day by day how to code.
        <br>

        <p>Using github was easier than i expected, but most things will probably be easier than what I think they are going to be since this is a new chapter in my life as I haven't had any prior experiences with html and css. But I knew that it wasn't something that I wouldn't overcome. I opened up my website using my repository. My TA's were really helpful with me. </p>

        <p>Then I started to brainstorm about my final project proposal. First, I thought about my interest in biomedical engineering and I tried to combine it with my personal experiences, and since smoking and lung cancer is prevalent in my family, I tried to think of something that would help decentivize smoking to help my grandfather. But then I realized that it was too complex for me to execute in such a class.

        <p> After thinking for a while, I decided that I wanted to create something related with basketball, my lifelong passion. You can find out about my final project idea in the proposal tab.
