  <h1>Lecture 1: Introduction and Documentation</h1>
  
  <p>
    In our first class of the course Introduction to Digital Fabrication, we started off with introducing ourselves, our backgrounds, and our motivation to take this course. Then we went over the course syllabus and talked about what our duties and responsibilites are. Mr. Melenbrink talked about how can we do good in our projects. Then we brainstormed about our final project ideas and talked to our peers about ideas. After getting assigned to our lab section, we ended our day with working on our 1st assignment of opening a website for our final project, briefly going over HTML and CSS while doing so.

  <h2>Assignment</h2>

  <p>
  Our first assignment was to open up a website from GitHub that would act as a journal tracking our development. To do this, we went over a tutorial about how to open up a GitHub repository, then we downloaded Sublime Text and used it to create and customize our own website with HTML and CSS. I am a beginner in coding so these steps were quite the challenge for me. But I'm staritng to figure out day by day how to code.  </p>
